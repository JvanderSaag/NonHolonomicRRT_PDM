# NonHolonomicRRT_PDM
Implementation of a RRT algorithm for a non-holonomic parking robot, created for the course Planning &amp; Decision Making (RO47005) at the Technische Universiteit Delft.


return_coordinates of the scenario class returns the coordinates of all obstacles (a list of list, each nested list is another obstacle), the coordinates of the path (with linear segments connecting each point), the coordinate of the start, and the coordinate of the goal. All coordinates are given as (x, y), with the origin being at the bottom left of the environment.
